This is my version of a CDE-lookie-likie environment using FVWM. It also includes an SGI 4DWM-like Toolchest because I think
that's pretty cool. It's made by me (using stuff I found on the web as a starting point) for me. It comes with NO WARRANTY 
WHATSOEVER - use it at your peril (I've not lost any limbs using it yet but your milage may vary).

For those wishing to use it - some backgrounds and icon sets are included (BeOS & SGI in particular as they are really nice) - 
I downloaded from gnome-look or similar web locations for my own personal use. All rights remain with the original creators etc.

If you like it, feel free to try it out. You will need FVWM2 with various modules (build them all) and HSETROOT in order for stuff
to work out-of-the-box. The screen resolution and other locations are hard-coded into the fvwmrc-config file. Update accordingly.
Natively, I think this is setup for 1280x1024 - which was the resolution that I was using when I created it.
